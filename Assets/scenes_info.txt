//a brief description of the game's scenes

menus and interludes

-selection_scene
It's just a button that changes to the next scene.
In this case, it just goes to the fist level of the game, "Leve_1_new"(currently).

-well_done 1 to 3
These scenes serve as interludes between levels, by giving a message of victory to the player and allowing them to proceed to
the next level whenever they want.
Their functionality and setup is the same as the "selection_scene".

-WinScreen
It provides the player with a victorious message after completing the last stage of the game.
Its functionality is the same as above.

cooking scenes (Level_ 1 to 4)
//Level1_new, Level2_new, Level3_new and Level_4
Being the main part of the game, in these scenes the player attempts to satisfy the demands of a finite number of customers 
 in each level by preparing them their preffered foods and drinks. Whenever that happens, a well_done scene is called, 
 congratulating the player and allowing them to continue on the next level.
The setup and functionality is the same on all such scenes, currently, however, each scene handles different ingredients, 
 different recipes and different numbers of recipes needing to be completed

 the following is a list of Game Objects within such a scene, including their functionality and how they affect the game
 (inactive or unneeded objects have been omitted)

 -Main Camera
 Includes CameraScript

 -SpawningPoint
 Its transform position is where treadmill ingredients get spawn.
 Within the editor we specify its list of ingredients and the speed of the game.

 -Furnace
 Located in the center of the screen, its collider is used as a target for clicked ingredients. When they indeed collide, the 
  ingredients get destroyed, and the foodlayer shows the appropriate layer eg a tomato ingredient now shows as a tomato would look 
  inside a sandwich.
Includes FurnaceScript.

 -Canvas
 All the UI elements are in here. Their shapes and sizes may change according to the CameraScript.
 --recipe board
 includes the following children
 ---Board
 It's just the rectangular canvas board graphic.
 ---Image (0) to 3
 The Graphics of the checklist. They show when we need them for a recipe and get ticked when we no longer need them.
 Their functionality is restricted on the current recipe only.
 ---RecImage
 This is the image of the complete recipe that a customer wants and appears within their thought bubble.
 --Money
 It's just a number(text) that shows on the cash register.
 --NextRecipeButton
 It used to be a button, but now it is not, with its functionality replaced from scripts.
 --QuitButton
 Self explanatory, it also allows the player to exit the game by pressing 'esc'.

 -EventSystem?

 -Treadmill_Anim
This is the treadmill animation. It consists of two sprites that get animated changing positions to appear as if they are looping
 interchangeably, just like a treadmill would. It doesn't interfere with anything else on the game.

 -GameMaster
 Includes the dictionary that assigns sprites to strings.

 -SpawningFoodLayer
 It is responsible for the food-layer's position, as well as for loading its prefab.

 -BackgroundObjects
 These objects are mainly just graphics, except where noted. Keep in mind their order in layer, as its important how they show.
 --Wall
 --Customer
 Includes CustomerScript.
 Also includes SpeechBubble, that changes to a 'thank you' message when done.
 --Outside
 The view beyond the canteen eg behind the customer.
 --Tent
 --Counter
 Includes a small green 'screen' object that shows in front of the cash register, so that the 'money text' appears better on it instead
 of its current sprite
 ---Paper Towels
