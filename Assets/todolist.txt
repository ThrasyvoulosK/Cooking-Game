Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

screen resolution issues:
-too much gets cut in higher resolutions?
-camerascript errors in menuscreens

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

ticked ingredients positions seem to change slightly from their un-ticked counterparts
-change their 'center' accordingly?

transactions
-level3: paper towels

saved game functionality: what to keep:
-scenery(for later levels)
usage in the game:
-save when exiting (esc key)
-'continue' on main-menu
--show as a screenshot

saved games
-change saved path (for functionality with android)


Gameplay Issues:
-using money?
-skill measuring?
-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?


Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
(this has happened both on build and editor)
-not now?
-now yes? randomly? RAM issue?

android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
-test?

screenshot metadata error
-warning message in editor
-between games, the previous screenshot is shown on the screen; not the current one



Other Concerns:

//ticked images
//-change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
//--too late?

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
