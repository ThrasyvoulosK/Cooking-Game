Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
----too late?

-change counter sprite?

screen resolution issues:
-too much gets cut in higher resolutions?

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

saved game functionality?

Transactions between levels

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

ticked ingredients positions seem to change slightly from their un-ticked counterparts
-change their 'center' accordingly?

ingredient text label issues:
-text appears above 'ticked' sprites

main menu (selection screen and)
-appearance according to the guide
-functionality according to the guide

speechbubble "thank-you" message needs to change

ticked ingredients
-start again
--change transparency?
---add 'tick' on top of them?
or
-keep as-is, move transparent object in front of text?
--parent object layer=7

Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing
-how do we know how many recipes we need?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:
levelselect/changescene (both starting scene and interludes)
-functionality intact?
--debug logs give strange numbers during runtime (eg scene 101, 201, etc)
---moves to the next scene, though...
ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
-not now?


Other Concerns:

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

recipenextbutton
-reappear?

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

Clean Code
