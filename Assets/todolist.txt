Cooking Game


Add/Edit:


food-ingredient-spawning should choose less random ingredients
-in later levels?
-generate a random float between 0 and 1
--eg if it is within 0-0.10, choose the first object etc
--if we don't need one ingredient at all we should zero its appearance value
--we should keep these values on a list
---and always check if their sum is equal to One

treadmill animation
-fix looping graphic

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"

coffee recipes appearance
-all ingredients on the same height?

text labels on treadmill ingredients
-not ui text?

Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing


Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder


Bugs:
error message when starting
-appears only once, doesn't reappear


Other Concerns:

synchronise all levels with current ui positions etc.

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

objects shrinking in size when clicked?

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

let the ingredients continue moving on the treadmill when clicked, but invsible?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

add new recipes
-level 4?
--coffee?

recipenextbutton
-reappear?

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
