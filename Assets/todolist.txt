Cooking Game


Add/Edit:


food-ingredient-spawning should choose less random ingredients
-generate a random float between 0 and 1
--eg if it is within 0-0.10, choose the first object etc
--if we don't need one ingredient at all we should zero its appearance value
--we should keep these values on a list
---and always check if their sum is equal to One

speed issues should be handled globally
-make a speed script
-different users should be able to use different speeds
--eg slower and faster

delay button between recipes
-invisible?

change recipe-check-list to an image-based one, instead of text-based
-similar to layered-food, arrange sprites in positions



Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing


Performance Issues:
-handle collisions on furnace
--currently double updates happen from both the furnace and the ingredients
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?


Bugs:


Other Concerns:

-add recipes
--according to the doc

ingredients should be added to the recipe when they collide with the layer/furnace?
-it was like this before. during the ingredient's flight multiple objects could be clicked

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

objects shrinking in size when clicked?

treadmill animation is buggy
