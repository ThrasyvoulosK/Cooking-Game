Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
----too late?

-change counter sprite?

screen resolution issues:
-too much gets cut in higher resolutions?

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

ticked ingredients positions seem to change slightly from their un-ticked counterparts
-change their 'center' accordingly?

transactions
-no-money?
-level1:  counter
-level2:  tent
-level3: paper towels
-level4: change wall colour betwenn 2-3 colours
three choices
-on click, change the next stage's object
--change stage
-(keep sprite of choice somewhere, don't delete on new scene)
-(keep name of selected object, so that we'll know what to change eg wall, counter, paper towels etc)


Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing
-how do we know how many recipes we need?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?

saved game functionality?

Transactions between levels

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:
levelselect/changescene (both starting scene and interludes)
-functionality intact?
--debug logs give strange numbers during runtime (eg scene 101, 201, etc)
---moves to the next scene, though...

ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
-not now?
-now yes? randomly? RAM issue?

android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
-test?

milkcoffeeicerecipe lacks milk on recipe list?
-no?

Early clicking on a treadmill (eg before it fully appears on screen) ingredient keeps its text
-solved?

Other Concerns:

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
