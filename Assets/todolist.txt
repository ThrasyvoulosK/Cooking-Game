Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

treadmill animation
-fix looping graphic

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"

text labels on treadmill ingredients
-not ui text?

android?
cameras and ratios

two lists to avoid complete randomness(for customers)
-similar to ingredients?
--(buggy) update gets called more than once, and it causes some anomalies instead


Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing


Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder


Bugs:
error message when starting
-appears only once, doesn't reappear


Other Concerns:

synchronise all levels with current ui positions etc.

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

objects shrinking in size when clicked?

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

//let the ingredients continue moving on the treadmill when clicked, but transparent with 'ticked' graphics

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

recipenextbutton
-reappear?

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
