Cooking Game


Add/Edit:


food-ingredient-spawning should choose less random ingredients
-generate a random float between 0 and 1
--eg if it is within 0-0.10, choose the first object etc
--if we don't need one ingredient at all we should zero its appearance value
--we should keep these values on a list
---and always check if their sum is equal to One

speed issues should be handled globally
-make a speed script
-different users should be able to use different speeds
--eg slower and faster


add new recipes
-level 3
-level 4

treadmill animation
-fix loop
--fit image to screen-size

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
replace with  new graphics
-speech bubble
--appear only when recipe is asked
---trigger only after the pause-between-recipes
---replace with thanks-bubble message
-recipe-check-list 
--stretched images?
--change to "ticked" graphics when done instead of deleting them
---use checkingredient(?) == 'zero'
---(their (empty) images stay on position even when "deleted")
-display money on cash-machine
-build positions?

recipes just fly above the plate when done
-put a customer with a collision similar to the furnace
--it will work just like the flying-ingredients before

Other Concerns:
