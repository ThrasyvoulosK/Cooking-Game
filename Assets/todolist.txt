Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

objects shrinking in size when clicked

functionality for layer
-different number of ingredients shape?
--eg compare recipe of one with recipe of four

layer
-0 is the first ingredient 
--change it when we have the correct one
-1 is the next etc
-reset when all of it is correct

function that assigns correct sprites to (flying) ingredients

function to reset images to null, if their ingredient number exceeds our new recipe's

instantiate food layer instead of just leaving it
change its sprites when interacted with
after a food layer is created, animate it flying away
-copy behaviour from ingredient flying

use z axis instead of order-in-layer


Gameplay Issues:

losing money?

skill measuring

speed changing


Performance Issues:


handle collisions on furnace
-currently double updates happen from both the furnace and the ingredients

for loop in recipe-check-list update

object pooling?
