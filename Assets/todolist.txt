Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

//fireworks!(particles) -is it good enough?

exit button position and texts and menus according to idgames conversation!
-consult aforementioned layouts

test with different screen resolutions

//language select error

//capitalise asap

main menu:
-info button?
-fade graphics when something isn't applied
//change option button images to the ones currently selected

exit button
-update functionality for exiting from menus
//-write 'exit' next to the button
-fix for game scenes


translations in menus
-apply the same for other leftover gameobjects eg 'speechbubble'

//read new level doc!
change recipes
-levels 1 to 4
add new levels
-5 to 10
add new recipes
-ice creams
-salads
-club sandwiches
new ingredients for old and new types of recipes

fix buttons
-sizes
-colours
-positions
-images
--initialise properly, with current data
--disable on clicking

transaction screen:
-proper translation of all its objects
-update actual transactions based on layouts

check if player has already played
-application.iseditor

graphics that need change
-first screen
--yellow pixel line on its left part
--'x' button remove
--subsequent menu screen 
---background graphic changes position (height?)

Gameplay Issues:
-using money?
-skill measuring?
-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
(this has happened both on build and editor)
-not now?
-now yes? randomly? RAM issue?

android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
-test?

screenshot metadata error
-warning message in editor
-between games, the previous screenshot is shown on the screen; not the current one

//saves not working?-path error?

//disabling menu objects causes errors



Other Concerns:

//ticked images
//-change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
//--too late?

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

transactions
-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels adn numbers of recipes?

saved game functionality: what to keep:
-keep scenery saved (for later levels)
-treadmill ingredients?
--and their positions
--and their sprites
-paper towels?
//-change saved path (for functionality with android)?

Clean Code
add necessary descriptions for the game's functionality
