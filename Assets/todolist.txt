Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make prefabs?
-update canvas scaler to the one of tour friend

//fireworks appear on the dark part of the screen,breaking the fourth wall

main menu fade graphics when something isn't applied?

initialise images on menus properly, with current data with loadmenuxml and savemenuxml
//--levels soon to be obsolete?
--keep: level?,character,language,sound?,music?
//check gamemaster dictionary for assignment to images

check if player has already played
-application.iseditor

//graphics that might need change
//-first screen
//--'x' button remove
//--subsequent menu screen 
//---background graphic changes position (height?)

//club sandwiches distances between ingredients should be 0.05
//-similar to set_ing_dist(...) function, but be careful about plate, potatoes and base starting from zero
//-fix potatoes!

feedback issues
-hovering ice cream ingredients?
//-different order in ice cream ingredients between recipe image and built recipe

intro-tutorial
//-video
--with audio?
//-play before first level

gameobject positions issues
1920x1300
-"ingredients" goes above black space
-'exit' button too

languages excel
-new words needed?

changing video

write some code to help testing
-eg code displaying a message about screen resolution

new feedback issues:
-art issues
--pink strawberry?
--big tomatoes on toasts
//-menu behaviour
-gameplay
--board
//--board transaction
--pots?
//--spawning objects repeats itself a lot?
//--add a progress bar that works also as a game menu, to replace the 'x'?
//---unity has a premade 'progress bar'. check it out

savemenu should keep level information

progress bar:
//-remove 'x'
-add a submenu that asks
--quit to menu
--quit to windows/android
--(continue?)
-the bar should show the level's number inside it
--inside a star graphic?

//some treadmill ingredients have bigger labels, while others have tiny ones
//-check all similar prefabs, to 'fit' words the same way

progress bar on different resolutions
-change canvas options like tour-friend on all scenes

after loading the game, the progress bar should load properly, too

integrate progress bar in other scenes

fix 'levelid' on progressBar to current level

Gameplay Issues:
//-using money?
//-skill measuring?
//-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?
-Make an excel file with our current 'lines', along with an empty space for the new ones

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary

Bugs:

treadmill ingredient names disappear before exiting
-sometimes?

Other Concerns:

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)
//objects shrinking in size when clicked?
//merge the furnace with foodlayer?
//spawning speed and leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

//transactions//-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels and numbers of recipes?

//change 'win' screen?-similar to 'congratulations' but without 'continue'
//Add new cheats for easier debugging
//-finish recipes with one click
