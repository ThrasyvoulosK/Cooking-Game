Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

screen resolution issues:
-too much gets cut in higher resolutions?

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

ticked ingredients positions seem to change slightly from their un-ticked counterparts
-change their 'center' accordingly?

Cheat Mode!
-don't forget to disable

transactions
//-level1:  counter
//-level2:  tent

//-level4: change wall colour betwenn 2-3 colours

saved game functionality: what to keep:
-level
-current graphics
--boughtables
--scenery(for later levels)
-money
-recipes played?
-number of recipes completed

Gameplay Issues:
-using money?
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing
-how do we know how many recipes we need?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?



Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
(this has happened both on build and editor)
-not now?
-now yes? randomly? RAM issue?

android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
-test?

Builds are buggy: (different between build and editor play)
-Language on main menu Title doesn't change!

camerascript errors

Other Concerns:

//ticked images
//-change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
//--too late?

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
