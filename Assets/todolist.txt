Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

objects shrinking in size when clicked


use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

food-ingredient-spawning should choose less random ingredients
-generate a random float between 0 and 1
--eg if it is within 0-0.10, choose the first object etc
--if we don't need one ingredient at all we should zero its appearance value
--we should keep these values on a list
---and always check if their sum is equal to One

speed issues should be handled globally
-make a speed script
-different users should be able to use different speeds
--eg slower and faster

differentiate (graphically) between different recipes
-eg toasts and sandwiches etc
make new/change sprite handling functions
-one for recipe bases
-one for recipe aboves
-the current one should be able to handle between toast and sandwich ingredients
--can be kept as-is. it is used for 'flying' ingredients
---No, it can't. Different graphics should be shown for different recipes

allow for a delay between recipes
-eg click a button to proceed
--should be invisible and unclickable,unless a recipe gets finished
--should not allow any new recipe to appear, unless clicked
---a while loop?
-if on, gameplay should not be allowed
--ingredients should be allowed to move, but not clickable?
--we shouldn't have an active recipe on
put all of the next-recipe code in a large 'if-paused' statement

change recipe-check-list to an image-based one, instead of text-based

the base of the recipe (eg the bottom bread of the toast/sandwich) should be depicted before clicking on anything


Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing


Performance Issues:
-handle collisions on furnace
--currently double updates happen from both the furnace and the ingredients
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?


Bugs:


Other Concerns:
-add recipes
--according to the doc
