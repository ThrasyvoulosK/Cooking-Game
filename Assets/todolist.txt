Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

//fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle-make them prefabs?

//fireworks appear on the dark part of the screen,breaking the fourth wall

main menu fade graphics when something isn't applied?

initialise images on menus properly, with current data with loadmenuxml and savemenuxml
//--levels soon to be obsolete?
--keep: level?,character,language,sound?,music?
//check gamemaster dictionary for assignment to images

exit button
-update functionality for exiting from menus
//-write 'exit' next to the button
//-fix for game scenes
-position and texts and menus according to idgames conversation!
--consult aforementioned layouts

check if player has already played
-application.iseditor

//graphics that might need change
//-first screen
//--'x' button remove
//--subsequent menu screen 
//---background graphic changes position (height?)

//club sandwiches distances between ingredients should be 0.05
//-similar to set_ing_dist(...) function, but be careful about plate, potatoes and base starting from zero
//-fix potatoes!

feedback issues
-hovering ice cream ingredients?
//-different order in ice cream ingredients between recipe image and built recipe

intro-tutorial
//-video
--with audio?
//-play before first level

gameobject positions issues
1920x1300
-"ingredients" goes above black space
-'exit' button too

languages excel
//-5 rows: English, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, plus type-of-object and notes
//-lines: The '[...]words" lists, except for capitals/other stuff we don't use
//--also include words not found in this, such as 'thanks' and transaction descriptions
//---DecDescription[...] function in Gamemaster
//---RecipeCheckScript's 'thank-you' bubbles are hadcoded within the graphics
---transaction descriptions might need some explaining
//export a (english+'comma'+greek) csv
-csv can be reimported by the localization package
//(use streamwriter?)
//-make a brief powerpoint, explaining the various types-of-objects with screenshots from the game 
//-Greek encoding issue on Excel? (Notepad++ displays it correctly)

video is no good
-it's a bit too 'flashy'
-change wording to be somewhat more suitables
-put 'speech bubbles' and 'arrows' instead of 'cards'

Gameplay Issues:
//-using money?
//-skill measuring?
//-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?
-Make an excel file with our current 'lines', along with an empty space for the new ones

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

//android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
//screenshot metadata error-warning message in editor-between games, the previous screenshot is shown on the screen; not the current one
//saves not working?//-path error?
//error warning about too small of a name to 'remove "(Clone)"' from its name?

treadmill ingredient names disappear before exiting
-sometimes?

Other Concerns:

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)
//objects shrinking in size when clicked?
//merge the furnace with foodlayer?
//spawning speed and leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

//transactions//-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels and numbers of recipes?

//change 'win' screen?-similar to 'congratulations' but without 'continue'
//Add new cheats for easier debugging
//-finish recipes with one click
