Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

treadmill animation
-fix looping graphic

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"

text labels on treadmill ingredients
-not ui text?

android?
cameras and ratios

Missing Graphics after Crash?

let the ingredients continue moving on the treadmill when clicked, but transparent with 'ticked' graphics
when we click on an ingredient
-clone it
--let the clone continue moving
--chnage its graphic
-the original continues with previous functionality

Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?
-skill measuring
-speed changing


Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder


Bugs:
error message when starting
-appears only once, doesn't reappear


Other Concerns:

synchronise all levels with current ui positions etc.

split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

objects shrinking in size when clicked?

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

use z axis instead of order-in-layer?



speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

recipenextbutton
-reappear?

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
