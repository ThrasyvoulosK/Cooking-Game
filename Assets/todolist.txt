Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?
-Make an excel file with our current 'lines', along with an empty space for the new ones

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary

Bugs:

treadmill ingredient names disappear before exiting
-sometimes?

//'play' button not working?
//-loading a level works though
//-problem with loading a saved game between different versions?
//--test it

Other Concerns:

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)
//objects shrinking in size when clicked?
//merge the furnace with foodlayer?
//spawning speed and leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

//transactions//-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels and numbers of recipes?

//change 'win' screen?-similar to 'congratulations' but without 'continue'
//Add new cheats for easier debugging
//-finish recipes with one click
