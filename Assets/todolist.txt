Cooking Game


Add/Edit:

Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

fireworks appear on the dark part of the screen,breaking the fourth wall

main menu:
//-info button
-fade graphics when something isn't applied
-initialise images on menus properly, with current data

exit button
-update functionality for exiting from menus
//-write 'exit' next to the button
//-fix for game scenes
-position and texts and menus according to idgames conversation!
--consult aforementioned layouts

check if player has already played
-application.iseditor

//graphics that might need change
//-first screen
//--'x' button remove
//--subsequent menu screen 
//---background graphic changes position (height?)

club sandwiches distances between ingredients should be smaller?

feedback issues
//-no info button
//-hovering ice cream ingredients?
-different order in ice cream ingredients between recipe image and built recipe

//recipe board texts overflow-chocolate and caramel syrups spill over other ingredients!--shorten names to 'chocolate s.' or 'choc. syrup'?-try smaller text sizes

intro-tutorial
-video
--with audio
-play before first level

gameobject positions issues
2:1
-transaction 7 (table decorations)
--green rectangle is wrong, because of the change in height center for thefirst two objects
-small board is visible behind large one
1920x1300
-"ingredients" goes above black space
-'exit' button too

//descriptions of transaction scenes 
//-'table decoration' too big for the screen in both languages?
//-wrong in places eg asking for colour when its a different thing altogether
//--just remove the word 'colour' when not needed

//add new objects to saves!-canvases, tables, tables' decorations, umbrellas and logos


Gameplay Issues:
-using money?
//-skill measuring?
//-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?

Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

//android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations

//screenshot metadata error-warning message in editor-between games, the previous screenshot is shown on the screen; not the current one

//saves not working?//-path error?

//error warning about too small of a name to 'remove "(Clone)"' from its name?

treadmill ingredient names disappear before exiting

Other Concerns:

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//merge the furnace with foodlayer?

//spawning speed and leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

//transactions//-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels adn numbers of recipes?

//change 'win' screen?-similar to 'congratulations' but without 'continue'

Add new cheats for easier debugging
//-make the one in gamemaster update a function
-search furnace for recipes with a specific ingredient
-finish recipes with one click

add company's logo as a splash screen?
