Cooking Game


Add/Edit:


food-ingredient-spawning should choose less random ingredients
-generate a random float between 0 and 1
--eg if it is within 0-0.10, choose the first object etc
--if we don't need one ingredient at all we should zero its appearance value
--we should keep these values on a list
---and always check if their sum is equal to One

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

add new recipes
-level 3
-level 4

treadmill animation
--fit image to screen-size

fix ui (check with layout images examples)
-recipe-check-list 
--stretched images?
--ticked images
---change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
-build positions?
-size/position of recipe being constructed vs recipe on thought bubble

recipes fly 
-animate them going towards the bubble
-customer
--disappear when they get their food
---along with bubble

recipenextbutton
-invisible?
-change its functionality to when foods/customers/bubbles disappear from the screen

Gameplay Issues:
-losing money?

-Resources Folder


Bugs:


Other Concerns:


split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

objects shrinking in size when clicked?

THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
-in subsequent foods?

use z axis instead of order-in-layer?
