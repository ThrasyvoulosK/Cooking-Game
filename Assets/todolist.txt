Cooking Game


Add/Edit:


Replace all sprites with the ones in the dictionary of gamemaster!

fix scenes so that updating them all becomes less of a hussle
-make them prefabs?

transactions
-level3: paper towels(instead of walls(level 4))

saved game functionality: what to keep:
-keep scenery saved (for later levels)
-treadmill ingredients?
--and their positions
--and their sprites
-paper towels?
//-change saved path (for functionality with android)?

level select levels could be loaded as the ones we currently have?
eg level2, when loaded, would have the chosen counter already changed
also, disable not played levels
-make them unlockables instead
???can all be achieved from the same save file???
-or is it a bad idea?

fix saving/loading errors
-image on 'continue' button doesn't update
--disble?
--generate image from saved xml data

mark down completed work on design doc

menu screens should appear separately
-don't delete anything
-put a back button

ingredioentsnames on checklist
//continue/save doesn't work
//-go to level1 if thers no saved game
menu
-'options' choice insteaad of separate 'language', 'levels' etc
-'sound' option?
difficulty options?
changes in levels adn numbers of recipes?
congratulations during play
ui gets cut
-proven, android 2:1, 2160*1080
--scale background objects (x=1.1) (no y)
---objects appear ot of nowhere and then disappear into thin air!
//keep money
//-+10 money instead!

exit button position
and texts and menus according to idgames conversation!



Gameplay Issues:
-using money?
-skill measuring?
-speed changing within the game?
-how do we know how many recipes we need in-game?

Add Functionality for Different Languages
-Determined by :
--'text'-labels on treadmill ingredients
--'thank you' messages
--speech???
--UI items (menus)?


Sounds???
-for negative and affirmative actions

possibilities?

Performance Issues:
-for loop in recipe-check-list update
-object pooling?
-Resources Folder
--fixing with dictionary


Bugs:

ingredient text label disappears a little before the object itself exits the screen
(this has happened both on build and editor)
-not now?
-now yes? randomly? RAM issue?

android screen should only be allowed on 'landscape' screen-orientations
-test?

screenshot metadata error
-warning message in editor
-between games, the previous screenshot is shown on the screen; not the current one



Other Concerns:

//ticked images
//-change only when the ingredient reaches the "plate"
//--too late?

//split counter image?(canvas&cashmachine&cuttingboard?)

//objects shrinking in size when clicked?

//THE FURNACE IS THE TOAST-MAKER!
//-merge?

//use z axis instead of order-in-layer?

speed issues:
-spawning speed
-leaving food and customer speed

change font of cash register to sth more appropriate, eg calculator?
